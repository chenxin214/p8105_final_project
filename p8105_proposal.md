## The Motivation for this project:

According to [the World Health Organization
(WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight),
more than two-thirds of adults are obese or overweight and one-sixth of
children are obese in the US. Obesity is [the fifth leading
risk](https://easo.org/media-portal/statistics/) for global death.
People overweight have a higher risk of getting more than [60 chronic
diseases](https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity-facts) like type 2
diabetes, heart disease, cancer, which also increases the medical cost.
The association between obesity and education level, income is intricate
and differs by gender, age, and race.

## The Intended Final Products:

A website about this project, a report about the process of this
project, some interactivity plots to visualize results, and a screencast
illustrating this project.

## The Anticipated Data Sources

[Data collected from Behavioral Risk Factor Sureillance System
(BRFSS)](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-Table-of-Overweight-and-Obesity-BMI-/fqb7-mgjf),
[Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention
(CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html#age)

## The Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding challenges

  - **Planned Analyses:**

<!-- end list -->

1.  Overview of US obesity and overweight.
2.  Focus on the state with the highest obesity and overweight rate
3.  Investigate the obesity and overweight based on `Education level`,
    `Gender`, `Race`, `Age`, `Income` etc.
4.  Apply Time Series Analysis to examine the time trend from 2011 to
    present.

<!-- end list -->

  - Visulizations:

<!-- end list -->

1.  Visulizing the US obesity and overweight rates geographically
2.  Visulizing the changes in obesity and overweight rates over time
3.  Visulizing the state with highest obesity and overweight
4.  Visulizing the difference of obesity rate group by ‘Educational
    Level’, ‘Gender’, ‘Race’, ‘Age’, or ‘Income’

<!-- end list -->

  - Coding Challenge: Since the data is huge, it might be a trouble to
    run or knit.
