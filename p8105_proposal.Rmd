## The Tentative Project Title:
* US Overweight and Obesity (BMI) Analysis (From 2011 to Present)

## The Motivation for This Project:
* According to [the World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight), more than two-thirds of adults are obese or overweight and one-sixth of children are obese in the US. Obesity is [the fifth leading risk](https://easo.org/media-portal/statistics/) for global death. People overweight have a higher risk of getting more than [60 chronic diseases](https://www.healthline.com/health/obesity-facts) like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, which also increases the medical cost. The association between obesity and education level, income is intricate and differs by gender, age, and race.

## The Intended Final Products:
* A website about this project
* A report about the process of this project
* Some interactivity plots to visualize results
* A screencast illustrating this project

## The Anticipated Data Sources

- [Data collected from Behavioral Risk Factor Sureillance System (BRFSS)](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-Table-of-Overweight-and-Obesity-BMI-/fqb7-mgjf)
- [Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/prevalence-maps.html#age)

## The Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding challenges

* **Planned Analyses:**
1. Overview of US obesity and overweight.
2. Focus on the state with the highest obesity and overweight rate
3. Investigate the obesity and overweight based on `Education level`, `Gender`, `Race`, `Age`, `Income` etc.
4. Apply Time Series Analysis to examine the time trend from 2011 to present.

* **Visulizations:**
1. Visulizing the US obesity and overweight rates geographically
2. Visulizing the changes in obesity and overweight rates over time
3. Visulizing the state with highest obesity and overweight
4. Visulizing the difference of obesity rate group by 'Educational Level',  'Gender', 'Race', 'Age', or 'Income' 

* **Coding Challenge:**
Since the data is huge, it might be a trouble to run or knit.

## The planned timeline

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
readxl::read_xlsx("./timeline.xlsx") %>% 
  knitr::kable()
